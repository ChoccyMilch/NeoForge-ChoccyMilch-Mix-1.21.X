This mod provides  weird, and random features that I think enhance the gameplay of Minecraft (This is a more satirical mod and does not take itself serious if it wasnt obvious). It adds various items including food, equipment, and more...

This mod is a means for me to learn, while having fun and allowing others to possible enjoy my work as well. If you enjoy this mod please spread the word. If you have an idea or suggestion and would like to contribute you are free to do that as well. There are many things planned and so I hope everyone enjoys the ride.

Mapping Names:
============
By default, the MDK is configured to use the official mapping names from Mojang for methods and fields 
in the Minecraft codebase. These names are covered by a specific license. All modders should be aware of this
license. For the latest license text, refer to the mapping file itself, or the reference copy here:
